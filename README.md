# Tilt-O-Matic

In order to be able to see the texts on the modules in my eurorack while standing in front of it, I needed it to tilt towards me.
So I designed some supports that make it tilt towards me at the top and the bottom.
The designs were made using openscad and 3D-printed.

The side pieces are connected with some bolts in the middle.
2 wooden bars were used to connect the side pieces.

The wedges are interconnected with a threaded rod, some wahsers and nuts.

I used an aluminium panel left over from some other project to add some rigidity to the construction.

In order to limit the tilt of the rack I added another bracket.

The rack cases are interconnected using wooden brackets.
The brackets were cut using a K40 laser from plywood, but they could be 3D-printed as well. 
I glued 2 of those brackets together for extra sturdyness.
